      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."Apple Inc.></a> <br>
    is an American multinational technology company that
      specializes in consumer electronics,<br />
      software and online services. Apple is the largest information technology
      company by revenue (<u> US$365.8</u> billion in <u>2021</u>) and, as of January
      <u>2021</u>, it is the world's most valuable company, the fourth-largest personal
      computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone
      manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology
      companies, alongside Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and
      Microsoft. Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976,
      by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell
      Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and
      Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer,
      the Apple II became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant
      financial success. The company went onto develop new computers featuring
      innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh,
      announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by
      Ridley Scott. By <u>1985</u>, the high cost of its products and power struggles
      between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple
      amicably, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees
      with him. As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved
      throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the
      lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on
      Intel-powered PC clones (also known as "Wintel"). In <u>1997</u>, weeks away from
      bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful
      operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the
      next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of
      tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical
      acclaim, launching memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple
      Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the
      company's product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and
      died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook. Apple became
      the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in
      August <u>2018</u>, then $2 trillion in August <u>2020</u>, and most recently $3
      trillion in January <u>2022</u>. The company receives criticism regarding the
      labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its
      business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials
      sourcing. The company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty, and is ranked
      as the world's most valuable brand.</div>
